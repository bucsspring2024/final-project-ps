## Project Description

Your goal is to scam-message people and get money out of them. Every day you have a new target, the goal is to get all of their money from their bank account by the end of the day. You get a certain number of turns before the day ends. You have to look at both the trust and money gain for each option (have 3 options per turn). If trust falls too low, they find out its a scam and you automatically lose. But if your too cautious, you won't get all the money in time. You can get bonus money from minigames.
