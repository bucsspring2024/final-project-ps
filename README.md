Your goal is to scam-message people and get money out of them. Every turn you have options of what type of scam to do, the goal is to meet the quto set by your boss by the end of the day. You get a certain number of turns before the day ends. You have to look at both the FBI trust and money gain for each option (have 3 options presented per turn). If trust falls too low, the FBI gonna get ya. But if your too cautious, you won't meet quota. You can get bonus money from minigames.
